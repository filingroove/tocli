# tocli

Very small utility to search through `torrent-grabber` search results and copy magnet link. 

Goal was to make a very small usable wrapper as fast as possible. Not sure I'm gonna modify or maintain it if it works for me ðŸ˜‰

## Install

```
$ npm i -g tocli
```

## Actually

I found much better torrent search API and I'll use that eventually, when I have time to update this tool
